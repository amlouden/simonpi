# Description
A quick & dirty script to emulate Raspberry family devices on your laptop.
It generates a valid sdcard image that could be deployed on real hardware and used as virtual storage for QEMU.

It could also run a custom image generated by third parties adopting the classic Raspberry Pi partition table. 

Powered with :heart: by Arch Linux Arm images

# Instructions
* ```git clone https://github.com/M0Rf30/simonpi.git```
* type 

```./simonpi -h for details```

You could transfer your sd img on a valid sdcard using this command:

```dd if=sd-arch-MODEL-qemu.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M```

where MODEL could be:
* rpi
* rpi-2
* rpi-3

and X could be mmcblk0 or other block devices

## For Arch Linux users
You could find sim-on-pi on AUR

```yaourt -S simonpi-git```

## Docker image
See the **How to** into **docker** folder

# Common issues
This script uses dnsmasq dhcp server to assign ip to guests VM. Please, check your ports on local machine.

You could use: 
```ss -ntl``` 
to view conflicts between this script and other services running on port 53.
